# Role-Based Access Control Assignment 

## Introduction

This is the frontend code for my project where I developed this using React.js and focuses on creating a user-friendly and responsive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) interface.

The RBAC UI is crafted to assist administrators in managing users, roles, and permissions, providing features such as:

- Adding, editing, and deleting users
- Dynamically assigning roles and permissions to users
- Searching and filtering users

## Specialities

### 1. Dashboard:
Provides a detailed overview of users and their assigned roles within the system.

### 2. User Management:
Enables adding, editing, and deleting users, along with managing their Active/Inactive status.

### 3. Permission Management:
Facilitates dynamic assignment and modification of permissions for different roles.

### 4. Search and Filter:
Offers the ability to search users by name or email and apply filters for efficient management.

### 5. Role Management:
Allows the creation of new roles, modification of existing ones, and deletion of unnecessary roles.


## Technologies
- React.js: For developing the user interface.
- React Router: To handle routing between various pages seamlessly.
- Styled-components: For applying CSS-in-JS styling.
- Context API: For managing global state, such as theme preferences.
